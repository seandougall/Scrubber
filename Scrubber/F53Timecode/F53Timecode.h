/*!
 F53Timecode provides functionality for timecode math, conversion to and from real time, and 
 several variants of string representations. Also implements the NSCoding protocol,
 so F53Timecode objects may be serialized and stored.
 
 F53Timecode objects are mutable. Any changes to the timing represented by the timecode will automatically
 trigger a "rebalance", adjusting so that hours range from 0 to 23, minutes from 0 to 59, seconds from 
 0 to 59, and frames within the range permitted by the framerate. This rebalance also takes care of any
 dropframe math that may need to take place.
 
 The advantages of F53Timecode over CoreAudio's SMPTETime struct are in its object-oriented design, which 
 allows for the rebalancing described above as well as object serialization and easier timecode math. 
 For situations where SMPTETime is needed but math, string parsing, or serialization is useful, the 
 F53TimecodeCoreAudioExt category extends F53Timecode to provide conversion to/from SMPTETime structs.

 Simply resets the framerate and rebalances. In most cases, the hours, minutes, seconds, and frames members will
 be unaffected (unless they are out of range of the new framerate and get rebalanced). For example, 
 1:01:00:23 @ 29.97nd will become approximately 1:01:00:23 @ 24fps. For methods that do more sophisticated conversions, see
 convertFramerateTo: and convertFramerateFromReelStartTo:.

/*!
 \param newFramerate The new framerate to set.
 
 Recalculates the timecode, preserving the number of seconds from 0:00:00:00. For example, 
 1:01:00:23 @ 29.97nd will become approximately 1:01:04:11 @ 24fps (as both represent 3,664.43 seconds from 0:00:00:00 in real time).
 
 If you are converting from video speed to film speed or vice versa, and need to treat timecode seconds equally,
 you can use setFramerate: to set the framerate (without recalcluating) to pull the value up or down, then use
 this method to do the conversion. For example:
 <div><code>// Reverse telecine<br/>
    F53Timecode *tc = [F53Timecode timecodeWithFramerate:F53Framerate2997nd hh:1 mm:1 ss:0 ff:23]; // 1:01:00:23 @ 29.97nd<br/>
    [tc setFramerate:F53Framerate30]; // -> 1:01:00:23 @ 30nd<br/>
    [tc convertFramerateTo:F53Framerate24]; // -> ca. 1:01:00:29 @ 24
 </code></div>

/*!
 \param newFramerate The new framerate to set.
 
 Recalculates the timecode, preserving the number of seconds from the most recent reel/act/hour start. For example, 
 1:01:00:23 @ 29.97nd will become approximately 1:01:00:20 @ 24fps (as both represent 60.82 seconds from 1:00:00:00 in real time).
 
 Note: This method and convertFramerateTo: will have the same effect in many cases. The differences will arise when
 pulling up or down (e.g. converting from 24 to 29.97) and when converting between drop frame and non-drop.
