# Scrubber
## Quick 'n' dirty MIDI Machine Code scrubbing.

A work in progress. Basic functionality is there, but it's currently hard-coded to 29.97 non-drop and a range of 1:00:00:00 to 1:10:00:00. That may change someday if I get around to it.

Note: The transport window lets you generate MTC as well, but the timing is pretty naive, and not guaranteed to be super accurate.
